## 💡 Development Tips

* **Frontend:** Located in the `src` folder (Next.js + TailwindCSS)
* **Backend:** Located in `src-tauri` (Rust + SQLite)
* **Config:**

  * Tauri settings → `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`
  * Tailwind config → `tailwind.config.js`
* Run `npm run tauri dev` for live reload.

## 🛠 Code Style

* Use **Prettier** for formatting
* Use **ESLint** for linting
* Keep Rust code formatted via:

cargo fmt
```
